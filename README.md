# Guess the Number 🎯

## Introduction
**Guess the Number** is a fun and interactive number-guessing game where players try to guess a randomly generated number within 10 attempts. The game provides hints and scores players based on the number of attempts taken. This project is beginner-friendly and demonstrates basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and user input handling in Python.

## How to Play 🕹️
1. The computer generates a random number.
2. The player has **10 chances** to guess the number.
3. After each incorrect guess, the game provides hints:
   - **"Hint: Choose a Lower Number"** (if the guess is too high).
   - **"Hint: Choose a Higher Number"** (if the guess is too low).
4. The scoring system works as follows:
   - **1st attempt** → **100 points**
   - **2nd attempt** → **90 points**
   - **3rd attempt** → **80 points**
   - ...
   - **10th attempt** → **10 points**
5. If the player fails to guess the number in 10 attempts, the correct number is revealed, and the game ends.
